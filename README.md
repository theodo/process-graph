# Process Graph

## Roadmap and ideas

 - Drag n Drop to reorder steps.
 - Saving configuration/current process in localStorage or equivalent.
 - Quick Reset.
 - Button to quicly copy current graph to the clipboard.
   - Note: as long as I find a way to do that without having to rewrite the renderer using canvas.
 - MaxWidth setting to the steps.
 - AutoSelect text color based on contrast of chosen color.
 - Toggle to hide the configuration pannel as it might get kind of heavy.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `docs` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Pushing after running this command will update github pages.
